# Ph.D. Project 3 : Neural Correlates of an Auditory Pitch â€“ Visual Size Cross-Modal Association Emerge Early during Perception

Humans have been shown to exhibit implicit perceptual associations across the
different senses. For example, subjects often associate high pitch tones with
small objects and low pitch tones with large objects. However, it is remains
unclear when and where these cross-modal associations are reflected in neural
signals, and whether they emerge at an early perceptual level or later decisional
level. In this study we investigated these questions using a modified version of
an implicit association task (IAT) combined with 128-channel EEG and two
approaches to single trial analysis. Our behavioural results revealed subjects
identified stimuli faster during congruent than incongruent blocks, even though
only a single stimulus was presented per trial. The EEG results demonstrated
that EEG components related to acoustic pitch and visual size were early in the
trial (~100 ms,~200 ms respectively), over temporal and frontal regions. For the
auditory trials, these EEG components were significantly predictive of single trial
reaction times, yet for the visual trials the components were not. As a result,
our data support an early and short-latency origin of cross-modal associations,
and suggest that these may originate in a bottom-up manner during early sensory
processing rather than from high-level inference processes. Importantly, our EEG
results were consistent across both EEG analysis methods, demonstrating that
our findings are robust to the statistical methodology used.
